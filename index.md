# The story

My first model railroad was a present from my father. I imagine it was his goal to push me in some kind of technical direction and he succeeded since it became my main hobby.
Depending on the space I had to my disposal, I build small and larger landscapes where up to 20 locomotives could make there turns. 

Now that I am retired, I constructed a “final” layout. Crawling under tables, doing precision work in difficult positions is not my game anymore.
But being a programmer, other possibilities opened to continue my beloved hobby. Since none of the commercial steering programs satisfied me, I programmed it myself. This made it possible to integrated any module.

And there was something new that interested me intensively: Artificial Intelligence. Reading books and articles about it, soon brought me to Neural Networks and Computer Vision. So how to combine this with my old hobby?
