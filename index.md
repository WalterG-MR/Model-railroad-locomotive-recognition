# The story

My first model railroad was a present from my father. I imagine it was his goal to push me in some kind of technical direction and he succeeded since it became my main hobby.
Depending on the space I had to my disposal, I build small and large landscapes where up to 20 locomotives could make there turns. 

Now that I am retired, I constructed a “final” layout. Crawling under tables, doing precision work in difficult positions is not my game anymore.
But being a programmer, other possibilities opened to continue my beloved hobby. Since none of the commercial steering programs satisfied me, I programmed it myself. This made it possible to integrated any module.

And there was something new that interested me intensively: Artificial Intelligence. Reading books and articles about it, soon brought me to Neural Networks and Computer Vision. So how to combine this with my old hobby?  Was it possible to train a model that could recognize a locomotive? 

Scanning through the internet i did not found anything alike. So i started buying books about Neural Networks and tried many ways to understand how it was to be done.
But everything i found was very specific to a certain goal, but how to apply it to other domains was not explained.

It took a while before i found a company called PyImageSearch that provided courses starting from the basic level of manipulating images in scripts going up to creating models for training and classifying images to recognize objects in those images. A new area of Computer Vision had started for me.

It was not cheap, but a hobby never is :-)  and since i reduced buying new items for my model railroad, i decided it was worth the costs.
So i started to follow the "Guru" course on Computer Vision. At the beginning i was afraid it would be far too high for me. It appeared that it was not easy and many things were really difficult to understand like thinking in 3 or more dimensions. But following the examples and applying them to my own images was interesting and satisfying when it finally worked. 

Now here it goes --> ready to dive into --- Computer Vision and Model Railroad
