It was then that I started to build a recognition module with the objective to recognize the brand of the locomotive passing by a camera. 
What I was going to use it for, was not relevant. Just being able to understand how Computer Vision works was my goal and it still is.

As people always tell you : you have to have a plan. Divide it in different steps. Think about every step. A good preparation is the beginning of succes.
With the basic knowledge of what i was aiming for i setup a plan 

-- setup a camera to take pictures
-- process those pictures 
-- display the result

yeah, that looked like a good plan.
